## How to Find Something

**Use [IMPLEMENTATION_MASTER_INDEX.md](IMPLEMENTATION_MASTER_INDEX.md)** — it's organized by task and role.

Examples:
- "I'm building a new package" → See index
- "I need to deploy something" → See index
- "What's the current product strategy?" → See index

---

## Keeping Docs Fresh

See [DOCS_OWNERSHIP.md](DOCS_OWNERSHIP.md) for:
- Who owns each doc
- How often it gets reviewed
- How to propose changes

Each doc has a "Last Updated" date at the top so you can see how current it is.

## Standards Enforced Here

All code and docs in Factory follow:
- **[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)** — Standing Orders and Hard Constraints
- **[Definition of Ready & Done](runbooks/definition-of-ready-done.md)** — Work quality gates
- **TypeScript strict** — zero `any` in public APIs
- **Zero-config deployment** — environment isolation prevents mistakes
