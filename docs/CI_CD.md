# CI/CD Architecture

This document is the canonical reference for how CI/CD works in the Latimer-Woods-Tech org. Every app inherits from this. If you're changing how CI works for a single app, you're probably doing it wrong — change it here.

```

Every app's CI is a thin caller of factory's reusable workflow. **Drift is not allowed** — if you need a different CI shape, propose a change to factory's reusable, don't fork the workflow into your app.

---

## Why factory is public

GitHub Team plan rule: **a private repo's reusable workflows are accessible only to other private repos**. Since 4 of our apps are public (HumanDesign, videoking, ijustus, xpelevator), factory must be public for them to consume reusable workflows. There are no secrets in factory's code — all secrets live in the GitHub Secrets vault. Verified safe.

---

## Skills (composite actions)

Factory publishes reusable composite actions under `skills/` in addition to reusable workflows. Composite actions are referenced at the **step level** (not job level) and are suited for bundling multi-tool testing pipelines.

### `skills/global/testing`

Runs the four standard quality gates in a single step: Vitest, Playwright, axe (via `@axe-core/playwright`), and CodeQL. Full documentation in [`skills/global/testing/README.md`](../skills/global/testing/README.md).

**Caller (unit tests only):**
```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
  - uses: Latimer-Woods-Tech/factory/skills/global/testing@main
    with:
      node_auth_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      run_playwright: 'false'
```

**Caller (full suite with CodeQL):**
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write   # required for CodeQL
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
  - uses: Latimer-Woods-Tech/factory/skills/global/testing@main
    with:
      node_auth_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      playwright_base_url: 'https://staging.example.com'
      run_codeql: 'true'
```

---

## The three reusable workflows
## The reusable workflows

### `_app-ci.yml`
Run on every push and PR. Authenticates to GitHub Packages so private `@latimer-woods-tech/*` deps install. Runs `typecheck`, `lint`, `test`, `build` from the app's package.json (skipping any that don't exist). If the repo contains `drizzle.config.*`, CI also fails fast on duplicate migration numbers or broken `meta/_journal.json` / snapshot references before install/build work starts.

**Caller:**
```yaml
jobs:
  ci:
    uses: Latimer-Woods-Tech/factory/.github/workflows/_app-ci.yml@main
    secrets: inherit
```

Full input/secret reference is in the workflow's header comment.

### `_app-deploy.yml`
Targets a GitHub Environment (`staging` or `production`) and deploys to Cloudflare Workers via `wrangler-action@v3`. Optional inline health check.

**Caller:**
```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    uses: Latimer-Woods-Tech/factory/.github/workflows/_app-deploy.yml@main
    with:
      environment: production
      health_url: https://app.example.com/healthz
    secrets: inherit
```

### `_app-ci-pnpm.yml`
Identical to `_app-ci.yml` but uses **pnpm** instead of npm. Use this for apps that commit a `pnpm-lock.yaml` (currently: videoking). Enforces `--frozen-lockfile` and applies the same Drizzle migration integrity guard.

**Caller:**
```yaml
jobs:
  ci:
    uses: Latimer-Woods-Tech/factory/.github/workflows/_app-ci-pnpm.yml@main
    secrets: inherit
```

### `_app-deploy-pages.yml`
Deploys a compiled frontend to Cloudflare Pages via `wrangler pages deploy`. Optionally runs a build step first and probes a health URL post-deploy. Use this for apps with a Pages frontend (e.g. HumanDesign / selfprime.net).

**Caller:**
```yaml
jobs:
  deploy-pages:
    uses: Latimer-Woods-Tech/factory/.github/workflows/_app-deploy-pages.yml@main
    with:
      project_name: prime-self-ui
      health_url: https://selfprime.net
    secrets: inherit
```

Full input/secret reference is in the workflow's header comment.

### `_app-deploy-pnpm.yml`
Identical to `_app-deploy.yml` but uses **pnpm** instead of npm. Passes `packageManager: pnpm` to `wrangler-action` so Wrangler resolves scripts through pnpm.

**Caller (with chained post-deploy verify — recommended for production):**
```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    uses: Latimer-Woods-Tech/factory/.github/workflows/_app-deploy-pnpm.yml@main
    with:
      environment: production
    secrets: inherit
  verify:
    needs: deploy
    uses: Latimer-Woods-Tech/factory/.github/workflows/_post-deploy-verify.yml@main
    with:
      health_url: https://app.example.com/healthz
      rollback_on_failure: true
      worker_name: app-production
    secrets: inherit
```

### `_post-deploy-verify.yml`
Stronger post-deploy check with retry/backoff plus optional auto-rollback to a captured prior version ID. Use this for production-grade deploys; the inline health check in `_app-deploy.yml` is fine for staging.

**Caller (chained):**
```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    uses: Latimer-Woods-Tech/factory/.github/workflows/_app-deploy.yml@main
    secrets: inherit
  verify:
    needs: deploy
    uses: Latimer-Woods-Tech/factory/.github/workflows/_post-deploy-verify.yml@main
    with:
      health_url: https://app.example.com/healthz
      rollback_on_failure: true
      worker_name: app-production
      previous_version_id: ${{ needs.deploy.outputs.previous_version_id }}
    secrets: inherit
```

---

## Authentication chain

How a deploy authenticates, end to end:

1. **App repo's workflow** is triggered by a push.
2. **`secrets: inherit`** passes org-level secrets into factory's reusable workflow.
3. **`actions/create-github-app-token@v2`** mints a short-lived (~1h) GitHub App installation token from `FACTORY_APP_ID` + `FACTORY_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`. This token has scoped access only to the Latimer-Woods-Tech org.
4. **GitHub Packages** uses that token to authenticate `npm ci` for `@latimer-woods-tech/*` deps.
5. **Cloudflare** is authenticated via `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` + `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` (org-level secrets).

No long-lived PATs in CI. The GitHub App is the source of truth.

---

## Required secrets (org-level)

These live at https://github.com/organizations/Latimer-Woods-Tech/settings/secrets/actions, visibility `all repositories`:

| Name | Source | Used by |
    ### `_app-ci-pnpm.yml`
    Identical to `_app-ci.yml` but uses **pnpm** instead of npm. Use this for apps that commit a `pnpm-lock.yaml` (currently: videoking). Enforces `--frozen-lockfile` and applies the same Drizzle migration integrity guard.
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | CF dashboard | Deploy workflows |
| `CF_API_TOKEN` | Legacy alias of above | Deprecated, will be removed |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Stripe dashboard | HumanDesign + payment-touching apps |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Stripe dashboard | Same |
| `NPM_TOKEN` | npm.com automation token | Future public publishes |
| `SENTRY_DSN_*` | Sentry project DSNs | Per-app observability |
| `HYPERDRIVE_*` | CF Hyperdrive config IDs | Per-app DB connection |
| `POSTHOG_PROJECT_TOKEN` | PostHog | Analytics |

To add a new org secret programmatically: see `docs/runbooks/secret-rotation.md`.

---

## Required repo state

Every consuming app repo must have:

1. **Default branch** named `main`.
2. **Repository ruleset** blocking force-push, deletion, non-linear history (already provisioned by factory's setup workflows).
3. **GitHub Environments** named `staging` and `production`.
   - Public repos: full required-reviewer protection on `production`.
   - Private repos on Team plan: bare environments only (Enterprise needed for required reviewers on private).
4. **CODEOWNERS** at `.github/CODEOWNERS`.
5. **A `package.json` at the working directory** the workflow targets (root by default).

If any of these are missing on a repo, run `factory/.github/workflows/setup-app-secrets.yml` and `scaffold-all-apps.yml` to bring it into compliance.

---


    ### `_app-deploy-pages.yml`
    Deploys a compiled frontend to Cloudflare Pages via `wrangler pages deploy`. Optionally runs a build step first and probes a health URL post-deploy. Use this for apps with a Pages frontend (e.g. HumanDesign / selfprime.net).

    **Caller:**
    ```yaml
    jobs:
      deploy-pages:
        uses: Latimer-Woods-Tech/factory/.github/workflows/_app-deploy-pages.yml@main
        with:
          project_name: prime-self-ui
          health_url: https://selfprime.net
        secrets: inherit
    ```

    Full input/secret reference is in the workflow's header comment.
# expected: {"access_level":"organization"}
```

Quick smoke test:
```yaml
# In any consumer repo, push this to a test branch:
name: smoke
on: { push: { branches: [smoke-test] } }
jobs:
  call:
    uses: Latimer-Woods-Tech/factory/.github/workflows/_app-ci.yml@main
    secrets: inherit
```

If that runs successfully, cross-repo access is healthy.

---

## Environment + ruleset matrix

| Env | Trigger | Reviewer required (public repo) | Reviewer required (private repo, Team) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `staging` | push to `staging/*` or `dev` branches | no | no |
| `production` | push to `main` | yes | no (bare env only) |

To upgrade private repos to required-reviewer protection on production, the org needs to be on GitHub Enterprise.

---

## Adding a new app

See [`NEW_APP_CHECKLIST.md`](NEW_APP_CHECKLIST.md).

---

## Adding a new reusable workflow

1. Create `factory/.github/workflows/_my-thing.yml`.
2. Top of file must be a header comment matching the format in the existing three (purpose, inputs, secrets, conventions, related workflows).
3. Test the workflow with a smoke caller in any private app repo before merging.
4. Update this doc + `README.md`'s repo map.
5. Open a PR.

The underscore prefix (`_*.yml`) is convention for "consumed-by-other-workflows-only, never run directly."

---

## Rollback playbook

If a deploy goes wrong:

1. **Automatic** — if the deploy workflow chained `_post-deploy-verify.yml` with `rollback_on_failure: true`, it already rolled back. Check the run logs.
2. **Manual** — `wrangler versions list --name <worker>` to see versions, then `wrangler versions rollback --name <worker> --version-id <id>`.
3. **Nuclear** — `git revert` the offending commit on `main`, push, let the deploy workflow run forward to the previous good state.

For DB-touching changes, see `docs/runbooks/incident-response.md`.

---

## Drift watch

The `factory-status-dashboard.yml` cron job checks every consumer repo's CI is using the reusable. Any inline CI gets flagged in `docs/STATUS.md` and should be migrated.

---

## Anti-patterns (don't do these)

- ❌ Forking factory's reusable workflow into an app and editing it locally
- ❌ Adding `secrets:` to a caller and hardcoding values; always use `secrets: inherit`
- ❌ Hardcoding secret names in app code; reference org secrets by name only
- ❌ Using long-lived PATs in CI; use the GitHub App
- ❌ Skipping `_post-deploy-verify.yml` for production deploys with money or user data
- ❌ Pushing to `main` without going through CI; rulesets should prevent this anyway
- ❌ Adding workflow files to factory that aren't documented in this file or `README.md`
- ❌ Building and deploying Cloudflare Pages with custom inline YAML instead of `_app-deploy-pages.yml`

## Autonomous PR Review Pipeline

> Added May 2026. This section documents the LLM-gated auto-merge system. Read alongside `docs/supervisor/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

### Overview

All non-infrastructure PRs opened by the `factory-cross-repo` bot go through a fully autonomous review-and-merge pipeline. No human is required for green-tier (docs/markdown) or yellow-tier (app source) PRs unless the retry limit is hit.

```
PR opened/synchronize
  └─► pr-review.yml (.github/workflows/pr-review.yml)
        ├─ Tier classification (red / yellow / green)
        ├─ Red tier → request human review immediately, stop
        └─ Green/Yellow tier:
              pr-review.mjs (.github/scripts/pr-review.mjs)
                1. Grok first-pass
                2. Claude second-pass
                Both LGTM → APPROVE + merge
                Either fails → CHANGES_REQUESTED (merged concerns)
                             → supervisor feedback loop fixes & re-triggers

supervisor-loop.yml (cron: every 4 hours + workflow_dispatch)
  └─► supervisor-core.mjs (.github/scripts/supervisor-core.mjs)
        1. runPrFeedbackLoop()  ← scans CHANGES_REQUESTED bot PRs, self-heals
        2. processIssues()      ← issue → analysis → scaffold → PR flow
```

### Tier Classification

| Tier | Paths | Review model |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Green** | `docs/**`, `*.md`, `session/**`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/**`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` | LLM consensus only; auto-merge on 2/2 approve |
| **Yellow** | `apps/*/src/**`, `client/**`, `tests/**` | LLM consensus only; auto-merge on 2/2 approve |
| **Red** | `packages/**`, `.github/workflows/**`, `wrangler.jsonc`, `migrations/**`, `scripts/**`, `skills/**` | Human review required; bot posts immediate notification |

### Required Secrets

| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude second-pass review |
| `GROK_API_KEY` | Grok first-pass review |
| `GH_APP_ID` | factory-cross-repo GitHub App identity |
| `GH_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` | factory-cross-repo auth |
| `MAX_REVIEW_ATTEMPTS` | Retry limit before escalation (default `3`) |
| `HUMAN_REVIEWER` | GitHub handle to notify on escalation (default `adrper79-dot`) |

### Escalation

After `MAX_REVIEW_ATTEMPTS` failed reviews on a single PR:
1. Label PR `supervisor:review-limit-reached`
2. File a GitHub issue describing the stall
3. Post a comment on the PR linking the issue
4. Request review from `HUMAN_REVIEWER` (GitHub notification)

### Hallucination Guards

Before the supervisor commits any LLM fix, three guards run:

1. **`checkGeneratedContent()`** — strips comments/strings then checks for constraint violations (`process.env`, `require`, `Buffer`, Node built-ins, Express/jwt); flags near-empty files and files exceeding `MAX_GENERATED_LINES` (default 800, configurable).
2. **`enforceSlotSchema()`** — strips hallucinated slot keys not in the template schema; nulls values matching a structured prompt-injection pattern.
3. **`fixAddressesConcerns()`** — verifies at least one concern keyword appears in added or removed lines of the diff.
