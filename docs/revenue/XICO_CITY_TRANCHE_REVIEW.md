# Xico City — Tranche Opportunity Review

**Date:** 2026-04-29  
**Reviewed repo:** `adrper79-dot/xico-city`  
**Verdict:** promising tranche asset and now committed to the full World Class 360 build, but not ready until the foundation is repaired first.

> **April 29 decision:** Build Xico City all the way through the World Class 360 plan. The earlier tranche-MVP framing is superseded for this iteration. The transaction-ready MVP remains the first proof gate, not the final target.

---

## 1. Executive verdict

Xico City is promising because it can become the **local-experience marketplace vertical** in the Factory tranche:

- travelers and locals discover curated Mexico City experiences,
- hosts list and sell experiences,
- Stripe Checkout and Stripe Connect create real transaction flow,
- Factory video automation can generate listing promo videos,
- Factory analytics/CRM can measure supply, demand, bookings, and LTV,
- Admin Studio can eventually operate disputes, moderation, payouts, and health.

However, Xico City is **less ADHD/introvert-friendly than Practitioner Video Studio** because marketplaces need supply acquisition, trust, safety, customer support, refunds, and local operations. That risk is accepted for World Class 360, so the build must lean hard on self-serve host onboarding, automation, seeded/demo content, operator tooling, and strict quality gates.

Recommended tranche role:

> Xico City should be the final app completed before tranche build-up, and completion now means the full 12-slice plan: foundations, identity, host onboarding, catalog, discovery, bookings, reviews/trust, subscriptions, payouts, curator tooling, compliance, and PWA polish.

## 2. How it fits the Factory portfolio

| Factory asset | Xico City use |
|---|---|
| `@adrper79-dot/auth` | traveler, host, curator, admin roles |
| `@adrper79-dot/stripe` | booking checkout, subscriptions, Connect payouts |
| `@adrper79-dot/neon` | marketplace data, audit ledger, bookings, hosts |
| `@adrper79-dot/analytics` | discovery → booking funnel, host activation, LTV |
| `@adrper79-dot/email` | booking confirmation, reminders, cancellation notices |
| `@adrper79-dot/content` / `copy` / `seo` | experience pages, neighborhood pages, programmatic SEO |
| `@adrper79-dot/video` / `schedule` | AI-generated listing videos and neighborhood guides |
| `@adrper79-dot/compliance` | consent, deletion, DMCA, dispute/audit trail |
| Admin Studio | operator workflows for moderation, bookings, refunds, hosts, payouts |

### Unique portfolio value

Xico City adds something the other apps do not: **real-world commerce and marketplace transaction data**. That improves the tranche story because it proves Factory can support:

- subscriptions,
- one-time payments,
- booking lifecycle,
- host onboarding,
- reviews/trust,
- payout operations,
- location/search UX,
- compliance and support workflows.

## 3. Product promise

The strongest product angle is not “generic travel marketplace.” That is too broad and competitive.

Better wedge:

> Curated Mexico City experiences with high-trust hosts, AI-assisted listing media, and simple booking.

Best initial verticals:

1. Food and neighborhood walks.
2. Wellness and practitioner experiences.
3. Culture/nightlife micro-events.
4. Creator-led local experiences.

The wellness/practitioner vertical has the strongest synergy with SelfPrime and Practitioner Video Studio.

---

## 4. Current repo state

### Strong

- The build plan is unusually mature: product, stack, architecture, observability, security, SLOs, compliance, DR, feature registry, and orchestrator are documented.
- The repo has a feature registry with 12 slices from foundations to PWA polish.
- S-00 implementation exists on main with Worker entry, health route, Sentry middleware, schema, CI, deploy workflow, and basic test.
- The product concept maps well to existing Factory packages.

### Not ready

The repo is currently not executable/releasable:

- no `package-lock.json`, so `npm ci` fails locally and in Actions,
- dependencies are not installed, so typecheck/test cannot run,
- latest GitHub Deploy/CI/Registry workflows are failing at dependency install,
- CI references `npm run lint` and `npm run build`, but the app package does not define those scripts,
- dependency versions use semver ranges instead of exact Factory pins,
- `wrangler.jsonc` enables `nodejs_compat`, which conflicts with the intended Workers-safe constraint posture,
- `/ready` appears mis-mounted: the router defines `/ready`, then the same router is mounted at `/ready`, making the real readiness route likely `/ready/ready` while `/ready` returns the health root,
- runtime code uses `global`, `global as any`, and console logging in production paths,
- schema has likely compile issues in table callbacks that reference `table` without receiving it in some callback parameters,
- no Drizzle migration SQL is committed despite schema acceptance criteria,
- no live `curl /health` verification exists for Xico City,
- no frontend/PWA exists,
- no booking checkout, host onboarding, or Stripe webhook implementation exists yet.

## 5. Opportunity assessment

### Promise score: 8.5/10

Xico City is promising as a tranche asset if built with strong operating discipline. It has a clear monetization path:

- booking fee / take rate,
- host subscription for better listings,
- traveler subscription for curated drops/member pricing,
- paid promo video generation for hosts,
- sponsored experiences or featured placements,
- affiliate partnerships later.

### Execution risk score: 7/10

Risk is high because marketplace apps create operational drag:

- supply acquisition,
- refunds/cancellations,
- disputes,
- no-shows,
- safety/trust,
- payout issues,
- customer support,
- local regulatory ambiguity.

### Strategic fit score: 8/10

It fits the Factory tranche as the **marketplace proof point**, while Practitioner Video Studio is the **fastest cash-flow proof point**.

### ADHD/introvert fit score: 5/10 unless heavily automated

A broad local marketplace is not ideal for introverted/no-outreach execution. The mitigation is to make host onboarding, demo content, SEO, listing media, booking support, refunds, and operator review workflows as self-serve and automated as possible.

## 6. Completion definition

World Class 360 defines Xico completion as all 12 planned slices. The transaction-ready MVP is still the first milestone because it proves the money path before the full marketplace expands.

First milestone — **Transaction-Ready Xico MVP**:

1. Public landing and category pages.
2. Auth/register/login/profile.
3. Host onboarding with Stripe Connect test mode.
4. Host creates an experience listing.
5. Admin approves listing.
6. Visitor browses/searches listing.
7. Visitor books with Stripe Checkout test mode.
8. Stripe webhook confirms booking idempotently.
9. Email confirmation sends.
10. Admin can see bookings and failed webhooks.
11. PostHog/factory_events capture the funnel.
12. `/health` and `/ready` return correct status and are curl-verified.
13. Basic PWA/mobile shell passes smoke and accessibility checks.

This is enough to show tranche value while the remaining slices continue.

Final World Class 360 completion adds:

1. Reviews and trust workflows.
2. Explorer/Local subscriptions.
3. Host payouts and payout reports.
4. Curator collections.
5. DMCA/GDPR/consent flows.
6. Installable PWA shell.
7. Accessibility and performance gates.
8. Synthetic monitoring and user-journey SLOs.
9. Admin Studio operator hooks.
10. Seed/demo data and launch package.

## 8. Synergy opportunities to capture

### Xico City × Practitioner Video Studio

Hosts can buy AI-generated listing videos:

- experience promo video,
- host intro video,
- neighborhood guide,
- post-booking recap.

This turns Practitioner Video Studio into a revenue tool inside Xico, not a separate distraction.

### Xico City × SelfPrime

SelfPrime practitioners can become Xico wellness hosts:

- Human Design reading sessions,
- wellness workshops,
- local retreats,
- private client experiences.

### Xico City × VideoKing patterns

Borrow:

- creator onboarding,
- payout audit,
- moderation queue,
- DLQ/retry patterns,
- revenue integrity review.

Do not couple runtime.

### Xico City × Admin Studio

Use Admin Studio as operator console for:

- host approvals,
- booking failures,
- webhook replay,
- refunds/disputes,
- payout status,
- SLO and synthetic checks.

## 9. Go/no-go decision

### Go, with full World Class 360 scope

Xico City is worth completing before pausing app expansion because it rounds out the tranche with a marketplace/commerce asset.

### Guardrail

A full marketplace build adds operational risk. The mitigation is not to shrink the target; it is to enforce strict slices, quality gates, direct verification, and operator tooling before public launch.

Recommended decision:

> Complete Xico City through the full World Class 360 plan, while using the transaction-ready MVP as the first gate and Practitioner Video Studio as the parallel revenue engine.
