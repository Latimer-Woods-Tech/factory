## W360 Dependencies and Sequencing

```
W360-031 (This) ← W360-035 (gates)
               ← W360-034 (config normalization)
               ← W360-032 (templates for new apps)
               ← W360-033 (standards enforcement)

W360-001 (DONE) → W360-031 (Portfolio Registry) → W360-034 (Config pass)
                                                 → W360-035 (Graduation gates)
                                                 → W360-032 (Templates)

## Recent Changes

**W360-031 — 2026-04-29:**
- Created initial full portfolio app scope registry
- Classified apps by type and W360 phase
- Documented graduation gate matrix (W360-035 prerequisite)
- Linked package dependency chain to W360 roadmap
- Established verification checklist for launch readiness

**Next Steps:**
1. W360-034: Audit configs across all apps + normalize
2. W360-035: Apply graduation gates to each app (prime-self passes, xico-city/admin-studio pending W360-005/006)
3. W360-032: Build template pack for pending apps (wordis-bond, cypher-healing, etc.)
