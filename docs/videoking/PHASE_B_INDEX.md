# VideoKing Phase B Implementation Index

**Date:** April 28, 2026  
**Status:** Phase B (Standardize) Launched  
**Core App Reference:** NicheStream/VideoKing

---

## Phase B Mission

Establish VideoKing as a **canonical reference implementation** for Factory applications. All new apps will:
- Follow VideoKing's patterns (architecture, testing, operations)
- Meet VideoKing's quality standards (SLOs, observability, runbooks)
- Adopt VideoKing's tools (same monitoring, same incident response)

## FAQ

**Q: When does Phase B start?**  
A: Phase B starts **May 1, 2026**. T5.1 metrics collection deploys that day.

**Q: Do all new apps need to follow VideoKing's patterns?**  
A: Yes. Phase B exists to make VideoKing the canonical reference. T4.1 will document which patterns are required (must-follow) vs optional (recommended).

**Q: What if SLO targets are unrealistic?**  
A: Document evidence + post to #ops. Adjust in real-time during first 2 weeks (May 1–14). Lock in targets by May 15.

**Q: Who gets paged for P1 incidents?**  
A: On-call engineer (on rotation). After 10 min unresolved: backup on-call + tech lead paged. See [ON_CALL_RUNBOOK.md](./ON_CALL_RUNBOOK.md) for escalation matrix.

**Q: How do I use VideoKing patterns in a new app?**  
A: Wait for T4.1 to publish (May 15). Then: clone VideoKing, delete app-specific code, keep scaffolding + patterns.

**Q: Can T5.1 be skipped?**  
A: No. T5.1 is foundational; T5.2 (observability) and T5.3 (incident response) depend on it. Other initiatives (T2.2, T3.1) also reference SLO targets.
