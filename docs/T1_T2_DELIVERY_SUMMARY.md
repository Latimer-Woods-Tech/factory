### Task T2.1: Refresh App Engineering Baseline

**File:** [docs/packages/videoking-engineering-baseline.mdx](./docs/packages/videoking-engineering-baseline.mdx)

**Contents:**

#### 1. Phase 4 Completion Summary
- ✅ **Dead Letter Queue System:** 11-column table, operator recovery API, webhook integration
- ✅ **Automatic Payout Distribution:** Daily cron, batch model, Stripe integration, DLQ failure recovery
- ✅ **Code Audit & Repairs:** 13 issues fixed (3 critical, 6 high, 3 medium, 1 low)
- ✅ **Build Verification:** TypeScript strict, ESLint zero warnings

#### 2. Current Architecture
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js 15, Hono, Neon PostgreSQL, Stripe, Cloudflare Stream, R2, Durable Objects, BetterAuth
- **Project Structure:** Monorepo with web (Pages), worker (API), db (schema), types packages
- **92-Table PostgreSQL Schema:** Fully documented (viewers, creators, content, monetization, operations, analytics, moderation tables)
- **Core API Endpoints:** 20+ endpoints documented (public, authenticated, creator dashboard, admin/operator)
- **Deployment Architecture:** Pages (itsjusus.com), Worker (api.itsjusus.com), R2 (assets.itsjusus.com)

#### 3. Test Coverage Baseline
- **Overall:** 75% lines, 68% branches (below 90%/85% target)
- **By package:**
  - apps/worker: 78% lines, 71% branches
  - packages/db: 85% lines, 79% branches
  - apps/web: 62% lines, 55% branches
- **Known gaps:** DLQ paths, webhook handlers, transcoding state machine, moderation, real-time reactions

#### 4. Risk Register
**5 High-Risk Items** (must address before scale):
- H1: Webhook timeout → payout miss (Mitigation: DLQ implemented)
- H2: DB connection pool exhaustion (Mitigation: monitor, alert)
- H3: Cloudflare Stream unavailable (Mitigation: graceful error handling)
- H4: Moderator queue backlog (Mitigation: auto-flag, SLA enforcement)
- H5: Creator account compromise (Mitigation: audit logs, 2FA)

**5 Medium-Risk Items** (Phase B/C targets):
- M1: No rate limiting (Phase B)
- M2: No transcoding auto-retry (Phase C)
- M3: Manual earnings disputes (Phase B)
- M4: Subscription access control missing (Phase B)
- M5: Thumbnail generation failures (Phase C)

**3 Low-Risk Items** (Phase D targets):
- L1: UI performance regression (Phase D)
- L2: Accessibility regression (Phase D)
- L3: GDPR data export (Phase D)

#### 5. Technical Debt (5 Items, Phased)
- T1: Video recommendations (basic recency; ML planned Phase B)
- T2: Real-time chat (no persistence; Phase B add SQLite)
- T3: Moderation (manual only; Phase C add Vision API)
- T4: Live streaming (not implemented; Phase C)
- T5: Creator analytics (basic counters; Phase D add cohort analysis)

#### 6. Known Limitations (5 Items, Documented)
- No offline mode
- No codec selection
- Single currency (USD)
- No referral program
- No creator-to-creator payments

#### 7. Recent Fixes
- **Payout Batching & Snapshot Model:** Immutable `payout_batches` table prevents double-pay; audit trail per batch; DLQ fallback for recovery

#### 8. Exit Criteria Verification
- [x] Build passes (TypeScript strict, ESLint clean)
- [x] Production live (all domains responding 200)
- [x] Phase 4 complete (DLQ, payouts, audit fixes shipped)
- [x] Test coverage baseline (75%/68% captured with gaps documented)
