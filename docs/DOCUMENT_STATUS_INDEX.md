# Document Status Index

**Last updated:** April 29, 2026  
**Purpose:** prevent stale planning artifacts from misleading future agents during the World Class 360 iteration.

## Status Legend

| Status | Meaning | Agent behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Canonical | Current source of truth | Read first; update when status changes |
| Active reference | Still useful and aligned | Use for implementation detail after canonical docs |
| Historical | Completed or superseded | Do not use as the active plan |
| Archive candidate | Likely outdated/no longer operational | Keep for record until coordinator archives |

| Document / pattern | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `*_COMPLETE.md` | Historical | Completion evidence only |
| `*_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` | Historical | Summary evidence only |

| `PHASE_D_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` | Historical | Past phase summary |
| `R2_PROVISIONING_COMPLETE.md` | Historical | R2 evidence; current open work lives in dashboard |
| `VIDEO_SECRETS_CONFIGURED.md` | Historical | Secret setup evidence; current verification lives in dashboard/runbooks |
| `BIRTHTIME_INPUT_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` | Historical | Completed implementation evidence |

## Archive Candidates

Do not delete automatically. Coordinator should review and either move to an archive folder or add a banner at the top stating that the file is historical.

| Document | Why it may be stale |
|---|---|
| `PHASE_6_READY_TO_EXECUTE.md` | Phase 6 infrastructure is already confirmed in later dashboard rows |
| `PHASE_6_7_READY_STATE.md` | Readiness state may be superseded by World Class 360 queue |
| `PHASE_6_7_TIMELINE.md` | Timeline may conflict with current W360 sequence |
| `PHASE_C_ACTIVATION_CHECKLIST.md` | Older phase checklist; verify against dashboard before use |
| `PHASE_C_EXECUTION_PLAYBOOK.md` | Older execution framing |
| `PHASE_C_KICKOFF_PACKAGE.md` | Older kickoff framing |
| `STAGE_1_FOUNDATION.md` | Stage document; not current active task board |
| `STAGE_6_ONWARDS_PLAN.md` | Superseded by current W360 queue for this iteration |
| `STAGES_2_5_AND_GUIDE.md` | Stage guide; historical unless dashboard references it |
| `FACTORY_STRATEGIC_REVIEW.md` | Strategy snapshot; may be superseded by W360 plan |
| `CAPABILITIES_ASSESSMENT.md` | Useful baseline but not current queue |
| `VIDEO_AUTOMATION_GAMEPLAN.md` | Verify against current video pipeline evidence before using |

## Agent Rule

When a document conflicts with the World Class 360 dashboard, follow this order:

1. `CLAUDE.md`
2. `WORLD_CLASS_IMPLEMENTATION_DASHBOARD.md`
3. `docs/operations/WORLD_CLASS_360_TASK_DASHBOARD.md`
4. `docs/service-registry.yml`
5. Active prompt files under `prompts/`
6. Active reference docs
7. Historical docs only as evidence
