# World Class 360 — Active Task Dashboard

**Date:** 2026-04-29  
**Status:** Active execution dashboard for this iteration  
**North star:** build the full World Class 360 tranche, including complete Xico City, Practitioner Video Studio, SelfPrime video/product proof, Admin Studio control plane, and Factory platform hardening.  
**Canonical parent:** `../../WORLD_CLASS_IMPLEMENTATION_DASHBOARD.md`  
**Standing orders:** `../../CLAUDE.md`
**Discipline breakdown:** `WORLD_CLASS_360_DISCIPLINE_BREAKDOWN.md`
**Scope gap review:** `WORLD_CLASS_360_SCOPE_GAP_REVIEW.md`
**Repo hardening execution plan:** `W360_FACTORY_REPO_HARDENING_PLAN.md`

---

## 1. Executive intent

The current iteration is no longer “MVP only.” The north star is **World Class 360**:

> Build a complete, credible tranche of Factory-backed applications that proves the platform can ship real products across AI media, practitioner/personalization, marketplace commerce, operations, release governance, and reusable infrastructure.

This means:

- Xico City is completed as a full app, not only a transaction demo.
- Practitioner Video Studio is the fastest revenue engine and must become self-serve.
- SelfPrime remains the proof surface for video, auth, UX, and practitioner positioning.
- Admin Studio becomes the safe operator/control plane.
- Factory package and workflow systems become release-train ready.
- Stale docs are marked, archived, or merged so agents do not execute outdated plans.

## 2. Current state snapshot

| Area | State | Success signal | Main gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Video pipeline | Verified happy path | R2 + Stream + render workflow succeeded | Revenue entitlement/credit bridge missing |
| SelfPrime | Live public proof | Stream embed, smoke, a11y, auth e2e green | Productized paid video studio not built |
| Xico City | Plan strong, repo unstable | Build plan/orchestrator exists | CI/deps/schema/routes/deploy need repair before full build |
| Admin Studio | ✅ Gates all pass | lint ✓ typecheck ✓ 31 tests ✓; RBAC/authz tests added; LLM-backed analysis; UI Code/AI/Functions tabs; studio-core 66 tests ✓ | Operator-facing live deployment not yet verified via curl |
| Packages | Published and integration-smoke protected | Package integration workflow passed | Release-train coordination and app lockfile drift not centralized |
| Docs | Rich but sprawling | Dashboard is canonical | Historical docs still compete for attention |
| Workflows | Many powerful automations | Video + package workflows prove value | No central workflow matrix/recovery register yet |

---

## 3. Priority model

| Priority | Meaning | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | Blocks parallel work or money-moving safety | Fix before starting dependent feature work |
| P1 | Required for World Class 360 ready state | Queue immediately after P0 |
| P2 | Important scale/polish work | Build once core loops prove green |
| P3 | Cleanup or future leverage | Schedule, do not interrupt core path |

---

## 3.1 Discipline model

World Class 360 work is no longer managed as one flat backlog. Every item should be categorized by discipline so specialist agents can own a coherent body of work and reviewers can be assigned by risk.

| Code | Discipline | Primary responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| D01 | Program coordination | Scope, sequencing, OWR/W360 status, dependencies, path ownership |
| D02 | Product and revenue | Offers, pricing, funnels, entitlements, product outcomes |
| D03 | UX, design, and brand | Journeys, accessibility UX, design tokens, brand packs, templates |
| D04 | Frontend and PWA | Pages apps, dashboards, onboarding, client state, PWA shell |
| D05 | Backend/API and Workers | Hono routes, middleware, manifests, health/ready, service boundaries |
| D06 | Data and migrations | Drizzle schema, migrations, RLS, seed/demo data, data lifecycle |
| D07 | Payments and commerce | Stripe, credits, bookings, refunds, payouts, reconciliation |
| D08 | AI, video, and media | Render pipeline, Remotion, LLM prompts, R2/Stream, validation |
| D09 | Platform, DevOps, and config | Workflows, Wrangler, secrets, env examples, deploy gates, Renovate |
| D10 | Observability and reliability | Sentry, PostHog, events, synthetic monitor, SLOs, rollback proof |
| D11 | Security, privacy, and compliance | RBAC, JWT policy, service tokens, GDPR, DMCA, audit requirements |
| D12 | QA and test engineering | Unit/integration/e2e/smoke/a11y/contract tests and quality gates |
| D13 | Documentation and enablement | Canonical docs, templates, runbooks, status index, archival policy |
| D14 | Growth, launch, and support ops | SEO, demo narrative, support scripts, refunds workflow, onboarding docs |

Detailed ownership and app/repo mapping lives in `docs/operations/WORLD_CLASS_360_DISCIPLINE_BREAKDOWN.md`.

## 4. Master queue

### P0 — Coordination, repo stability, and safety

| ID | Workstream | Owner team | Scope / paths | Dependencies | Exit criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| W360-001 | Resolve agent collision risk | Coordinator | Factory working tree, path ownership table | None | ✅ DONE 2026-04-29 — `docs/operations/PATH_OWNERSHIP_TABLE.md` created and Factory working tree verified clean before/after validation runs |
| W360-002 | Create workflow coordination matrix | DevOps | `.github/workflows/`, `docs/runbooks/`, `docs/operations/` | W360-001 | ✅ DONE 2026-04-29 — matrix created and shared deploy-gate contract implemented in `scripts/verify-http-endpoint.mjs` + deploy workflow wiring for schedule-worker/video-cron/synthetic-monitor/admin-studio |
| W360-003 | Xico City repo stabilization | Xico platform team | `C:/Users/Ultimate Warrior/Documents/GitHub/xico-city` | none | ⚠️ PARTIALLY UNBLOCKED 2026-04-30 — stabilization fixes landed in xico-city: vitest peer conflict **FIXED** (`00a8f82`: vitest + @vitest/coverage-v8 bumped to `^2.1.0`) and missing clean-gate scripts **FIXED** (`62a096b`: added `lint` and `build` scripts). Remaining blocker is environment auth only: `npm install` still fails with `E401 Unauthorized` on `@adrper79-dot/*` packages until GitHub Packages token is configured in xico-city `.npmrc`; once set, generate `package-lock.json`, rerun clean gates, and unblock W360-004. |
| W360-004 | Xico City Worker health deploy | Xico platform team | Xico `wrangler.jsonc`, deploy workflow, service registry | W360-003 | ⚠️ BLOCKED 2026-04-30 — upstream W360-003 is partially unblocked (vitest conflict fixed), but deploy remains blocked until `.npmrc` auth is configured and lockfile is generated via successful `npm install`; after that, rerun clean gates and proceed to deploy/health curl verification. |
| W360-005 | Practitioner Studio entitlement bridge | Revenue API team | product API, entitlement tables, Stripe webhook, credit ledger | video pipeline baseline | ⚡ IN PROGRESS (runtime nearly clear) 2026-04-30 — production deploy verification now shows core ingress live: `curl -i https://admin-studio-production.adrper79.workers.dev/health` → `200`, `curl -i https://schedule-worker.adrper79.workers.dev/stripe/health` → `200`, and schedule-worker manifest now includes `/stripe/health` route metadata. Remaining blocker is configuration-only: `POST /webhooks/studio-subscriptions` on admin-studio production currently returns `503 {"error":"Webhook receiver not configured"}` because `STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is not set in repo secrets. Workflow hardening landed to provision this secret automatically when present (`fix(admin-studio): provision stripe webhook secret during deploy`), and to warn without blocking deploy when absent. Final closeout step: add GitHub secret `STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, rerun `deploy-admin-studio.yml` (env=production), then run Stripe test-card webhook ACK verification. |
| W360-006 | Admin Studio production safety gate | Admin Studio team | `apps/admin-studio`, `apps/admin-studio-ui`, `packages/studio-core` | W360-001 | ✅ DONE 2026-04-29 — RBAC + negative auth coverage added (`apps/admin-studio/src/routes/security-authz.test.ts`), audited mutation pipeline active, protected smoke runner validated, dry-run previews in deploy/test/payout flows, `/tests/runs/:id/analyze` upgraded to LLM-backed path with safe fallback, and admin-studio-ui Code/AI/Functions tab shell passes lint/typecheck/build |

## 5. Xico City full-build slice plan

World Class 360 means building all Xico City slices. The execution order remains strict because later marketplace features depend on stable identity, schema, and money-moving flows.

| Slice | Name | World Class 360 completion target | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| X0 | Repo stabilization | CI green, lockfile, scripts, exact pins, no forbidden runtime patterns | none |
| S-00 | Foundations | health/ready/Sentry/schema/CI/deploy/curl gate actually pass | X0 |
| S-01 | Identity & profiles | secure auth, refresh rotation, profile, avatar | S-00 |
| S-02 | Host onboarding | Stripe Connect Express, KYC state, host dashboard skeleton | S-01 |
| S-03 | Experience catalog | create/version/schedule/media/admin moderation | S-02 |
| S-04 | Discovery | search, filters, map, neighborhood/category pages | S-03 |
| S-05 | Bookings | checkout, idempotent webhook, cancellations/refunds | S-04 |
| S-06 | Reviews & trust | verified reviews, helpful votes, host responses, reports | S-05 |
| S-07 | Subscriptions | Explorer/Local tiers, member prices, billing portal | S-05 |
| S-08 | Payouts | Connect transfers, payout reports, exception handling | S-05/S-02 |
| S-09 | Curator tooling | collections, share links, public curated journeys | S-04 |
| S-10 | Compliance | DMCA, GDPR, consent logs, moderator console | S-01/S-03 |
| S-11 | PWA polish | offline shell, installable app, push, a11y/performance | S-04+ |

## 6. Practitioner Video Studio slice plan

| Slice | Name | Completion target | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| PVS-00 | Revenue foundation | plan catalog, checkout, signed webhook, entitlement, credits | video baseline |

## 7. Admin Studio slice plan

| Slice | Name | Completion target | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| AS-00 | Working-tree cleanup | active Admin Studio/studio-core changes accounted for | W360-001 |
| AS-01 | Auth/RBAC | all sensitive APIs protected by roles | AS-00 |
| AS-02 | Audit middleware | every mutation writes factory_events/audit row | AS-01 |
| AS-03 | Dry-run command model | command schema, risk tier, diff preview, rollback plan | AS-02 |
| AS-04 | Smoke/test runner hardening | protected live/staging smoke runner and evidence capture | AS-02 |
| AS-05 | Deploy control | staging/prod deploys with health gates and rollback | W360-002, AS-03 |
| AS-06 | Function explorer | manifests ingested and displayed with reversibility/SLO | W360-024 |
| AS-07 | Release train UI | package/app/workflow version drift and deploy state | W360-025 |

## 8. Documentation hygiene queue

### Keep canonical

- `CLAUDE.md`
- `WORLD_CLASS_IMPLEMENTATION_DASHBOARD.md`
- `MASTER_INDEX.md`
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md`
- `docs/service-registry.yml`
- `docs/operations/WORLD_CLASS_360_TASK_DASHBOARD.md`
- `docs/revenue/PRACTITIONER_VIDEO_STUDIO_READY_STATE_PLAN.md`
- `docs/revenue/XICO_CITY_TRANCHE_REVIEW.md`
- `docs/operations/WORLD_CLASS_360_SCOPE_GAP_REVIEW.md`
- `docs/operations/WORLD_CLASS_360_DISCIPLINE_BREAKDOWN.md`
- `prompts/README.md`
- `prompts/AGENT_SUCCESS_CONTRACT.md`

### Mark historical or archive

| Pattern/file group | Action | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| root `*_SUMMARY.md`, `*_COMPLETE.md` | archive to `docs/archive/session-summaries/` or add historical banner | session artifacts compete with dashboard |
| `STAGE_0_*`, `STAGE_1_*`, `STAGES_2_5*`, `STAGE_5_COMPLETE.md` | archive/mark historical | superseded by World Class 360 dashboard |
| clean pass reports | archive to `docs/archive/clean-passes/` | useful evidence, not live plan |
| old Phase C/D kickoff/completion docs | mark historical unless actively used | prevent stale phase confusion |
| VideoKing phase refresh docs | keep baseline docs; archive one-off refresh summary if duplicated | VideoKing remains pattern source |

### Create

- `docs/DOCUMENT_STATUS_INDEX.md` — **created**; every major doc gets status: canonical, active reference, historical, archive candidate.
- `docs/operations/WORKFLOW_COORDINATION_MATRIX.md` — **created**; critical workflows, deploy gates, and immediate coordination backlog are listed.
- `docs/archive/README.md` — still needed after coordinator approves archive moves.

## 9. Escaped items to add in this pass

1. **Workflow registry** — workflows need metadata and recovery instructions.
2. **Event verification gate** — revenue and booking events must be tested like code.
3. **Cost guardrail gate** — no render or marketplace flow launches without cost controls.
4. **Customer support runbook** — refund, failed render, failed booking, login issue, data deletion.
5. **Seed/demo data strategy** — Xico needs believable listings and demo users for launch and testing.
6. **Terms/refund/compliance lockstep** — legal pages must ship before checkout goes public.
7. **Synthetic monitor expansion** — add Xico, checkout, dashboard, webhook canaries once routes exist.
8. **Package version drift monitor** — app repos must not silently lag Factory package versions.
9. **Secrets inventory refresh** — confirm all app repos have required secrets and no stale names.
10. **Rollback rehearsal** — run one non-destructive rollback drill per deployed Worker before public launch.
11. **Discipline routing** — every work item needs a lead discipline, reviewer discipline, risk tier, and evidence requirement.
12. **Template pack** — build reusable templates before repeating app/revenue/support work manually.
13. **Standards catalog** — standards must be enforceable checks, not scattered prose.
14. **Config normalization** — all W360-critical repos need aligned Wrangler, CI, package, lint, test, telemetry, and secret conventions.

---

## 10. Immediate execution order

1. Commit or consciously isolate current Factory doc/dashboard changes.
2. Resolve active working-tree collision risk.
3. Create workflow coordination matrix. **Done as document; shared deploy-gate implementation remains open.**
4. Assign discipline owners/reviewers for W360-001 through W360-038.
5. Complete portfolio app scope registry and config/template/standards gap tickets.
6. Stabilize Xico City repo and CI.
7. Implement Practitioner Studio entitlement/credit bridge.
8. Implement Xico S-00 true foundations and deploy/curl verify.
9. Run Admin Studio safety hardening.
10. Begin parallel product loops:
   - Xico S-01/S-02/S-03,
   - Practitioner Studio PVS-01/PVS-02,
   - Admin Studio AS-02/AS-03,
   - Observability W360-021/W360-022.

## 11. Completion definition for World Class 360 iteration

This iteration is complete when:

- Practitioner Video Studio has a paid self-serve render loop.
- Xico City completes all S-00 through S-11 slices with live or staged proof.
- SelfPrime remains healthy and tied to the video proof surface.
- Admin Studio can safely observe and operate core workflows with RBAC/audit/dry-run.
- Factory packages have release-train discipline and cross-package CI.
- Workflows have a coordination matrix and recovery runbooks.
- Full app/repo scope is explicitly tracked by discipline.
- Templates, standards, and configs are normalized enough that future apps do not reinvent launch-critical work.
- Stale docs are archived or marked historical.
- The dashboard has evidence-backed status for every active workstream.
