/**
 * Phase C — Test runner types.
 *
 * The test runner has three actors:
 *   1. Studio Worker  — accepts dispatch, persists run state, streams events
 *   2. GitHub Actions — actually runs vitest, uploads JUnit + console output
 *   3. Webhook back   — POST /tests/webhook with HMAC-signed payloads
 *
 * Run lifecycle:
 *   queued → dispatched → running → (passed | failed | cancelled | timed-out)
 *
 * Events emitted on the SSE channel mirror these state transitions plus
 * per-test results so the UI can build a tree incrementally.
