## What Prime Self Is

Prime Self is a Human Design intelligence platform.
It calculates a person's **Free Energy Blueprint** using their birth date, birth time, and birth location,
then delivers an AI-generated synthesis that explains their design in plain, modern language.

Prime Self is NOT astrology, NOT a personality test, NOT a wellness app.
It is a precision instrument for self-knowledge, professional clarity, and strategic decision-making.

## The Methodology: Human Design Fundamentals

Human Design is a synthesis of quantum physics, Kabbalah, I Ching, Astrology, and the Chakra system.
Prime Self's AI processes the chart and translates it into actionable, specific guidance.

### The Five Energy Types

| Type | Population | Core Strategy | Signature (feel when aligned) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Generator** | ~35% | Respond to what lights you up | Satisfaction |
| **Manifesting Generator** | ~33% | Respond, then initiate rapidly | Satisfaction + Peace |
| **Projector** | ~21% | Wait for invitation before guiding | Success |
| **Manifestor** | ~9% | Inform before you act | Peace |
| **Reflector** | ~1% | Wait 28 days before major decisions | Surprise |

### The Nine Centers

The Human Design body graph has 9 energy centers (head, ajna, throat, G-center, heart/ego,
sacral, solar plexus, spleen, root). Each center is either **defined** (consistent source of that energy)
or **undefined** (open to environmental conditioning). Defined centers drive; undefined centers
receive and amplify.

### Authority (Inner Decision-Making Guidance)

Each person has an **Authority** — the correct inner faculty to use for decisions:
Sacral (gut response), Emotional (wait for emotional clarity), Splenic (in-the-moment instinct),
Self-Projected (hearing yourself talk), Ego (willpower), Mental (sounding board with someone trusted),
Lunar (28-day cycle for Reflectors).

### Gates and Channels

64 Gates correspond to the 64 hexagrams of the I Ching. When two complementary gates connect
two centers, they form a Channel — a consistent, defined energy trait. Gate activations come from
the natal planetary positions at birth.

### The AI Synthesis

The Prime Self AI Synthesis is a personalized, written interpretation of the chart.
It translates gate activations, defined centers, channels, and type/authority into
specific, actionable paragraphs about work style, relationships, health patterns, and purpose.
It uses modern language — no jargon, no mysticism.

## Brand Voice Rules — Non-Negotiable

EVERY script must follow these rules without exception:

### Voice & Tone
- **Second person always.** Address the viewer as "you" — never "they", never "our users".
- **Confident, not hedging.** Never use: might, maybe, could, perhaps, sometimes, often.
- **Direct, not filler.** Never open with: "Hey everyone", "In today's video", "Welcome back", "Let's dive in".
- **Active voice only.** Never: "your results will be shown to you" → always: "you'll see your results".
- **Specific, not vague.** Never: "learn about yourself" → always: "see your Energy Type, your Authority, and your strongest Gates".

### Sentence Length
- Maximum 18 words per sentence.
- Vary sentence length — mix short punchy sentences (6–10 words) with medium ones (12–18 words).
- No run-on sentences. One idea per sentence.

### Forbidden Words (Brand Compliance)
Never use any of these words in a script:
journey, transformation, transformative, game-changer, game-changing, unlock, empower, empowering,
leverage, synergy, holistic, amazing, incredible, awesome, excited, just, really, very,
delve, utilize, comprehensive, seamless, robust, groundbreaking, cutting-edge

### Approved Action Words
discover, understand, see, read, apply, use, know, access, open, set, review, find, build

## Eric — The Prime Self Voice (ElevenLabs)

Eric narrates all Prime Self videos. His voice is:
- Measured pace — never rushed, never slow
- Smooth and trustworthy — not salesy, not hype
- Confident authority — he knows what he's talking about
- Slight warmth — direct but not cold

**Write for Eric:** Short sentences, natural pauses implied by periods. No em dashes (they break ElevenLabs).
No ellipses. No exclamation marks. Commas signal natural breath pauses — use them correctly.

---

## What Prime Self Is NOT

Never imply any of the following:
- Medical or psychological advice
- Guaranteed outcomes ("you WILL feel", "you WILL earn")
- Astrology or traditional metaphysics branding
- Quick fixes or instant results
- Claims that Human Design is "scientifically proven"

## Formatting Rules for LLM Script Output

For TrainingVideo (JSON output required):
- `script`: The full narration. Must sync with the `steps` array. Each step gets approximately equal
  narration time.
- `steps`: Array of step labels shown on screen. 6–8 words each. Imperative tone. ("Enter your birth data"
  not "How to enter your birth data")

For MarketingVideo and WalkthroughVideo (plain text):
- Output ONLY the narration script text.
- No labels, no JSON, no formatting markers.
- The script IS the narration — exactly what Eric will say.
