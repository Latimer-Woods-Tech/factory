# World-Class Implementation Dashboard

**Last Updated:** April 29, 2026 (WORLD CLASS 360 TASK DASHBOARD LOADED)  
**Phase B Progress:** 28/28 (100% Complete) 🎉  
**Status:** Canonical execution dashboard, work register, and coordination process  
**Scope:** Factory support platform + core application delivery model  
**Reference Core App:** `_external_reviews/videoking` as the current quality and operating baseline

---

## Executive Verdict

The current plan is a strong **delivery foundation**, but it is **not yet the best plan** for reaching a world-class product and platform.

What is strong today:
- Factory has real package boundaries, strong standing orders, and automation for provisioning and scaffolding.
- The core app has meaningful product depth, strong edge-native architecture, and solid monetization building blocks.
- Quality gates, documentation, and deployment patterns already exist.

What is still missing for world-class execution:
- A single operating model that connects **Factory support**, **core app delivery**, and **UI/UX quality**.
- A clearly documented separation between **shared platform responsibilities** and **app-specific responsibilities**.
- A design and product quality bar with measurable UX, accessibility, and conversion targets.
- A release and review process that treats product, design, analytics, reliability, and operations as one system.
- A dashboard that sequences the work by outcomes, not just by infrastructure or isolated features.

**Conclusion:** the plan needed improvement. This dashboard is the updated implementation plan.

---

## North Star

**Current iteration north star:** World Class 360. The active execution queue is `docs/operations/WORLD_CLASS_360_TASK_DASHBOARD.md`.
For cross-cutting platform/control-plane hardening, use `docs/operations/W360_FACTORY_REPO_HARDENING_PLAN.md` as the detailed execution spec.

Build a portfolio system where each app can ship with:
- world-class user experience,
- production-grade reliability,
- measurable business performance,
- repeatable engineering discipline,
- and a Factory support layer that accelerates delivery without leaking app-specific logic into shared infrastructure.

---

## Planning Principles

1. **Product quality is a first-class requirement.** A platform is not world-class if the user journeys are confusing, inaccessible, or visually inconsistent.
2. **Shared infrastructure must stay shared.** Factory owns reusable capabilities, guardrails, and templates; apps own product-specific behavior and UX.
3. **Every roadmap item must end in a measurable outcome.** No vague “improve X” tasks.
4. **Operational excellence is part of product quality.** SLOs, incident handling, observability, and rollback must be designed up front.
5. **Design and engineering must move together.** No separate “polish later” track.
6. **Monetization systems require auditability.** Payouts, subscriptions, unlocks, and analytics need explicit operator workflows and regression protection.
7. **Documentation must match the actual delivery motion.** Status docs cannot drift behind reality.

## Responsibility Model

| Area | Factory Support Owns | Core Application Owns |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture guardrails | Worker patterns, auth patterns, analytics contracts, deploy templates, QA gates | Product-specific route design, state models, failure handling within domain workflows |
| Developer experience | Scaffold, CI templates, verification scripts, shared lint/type/test policy | App-specific test suites, app-level runbooks, feature-specific fixtures |
| Reliability | Monitoring package, error reporting package, release/runbook standards | App SLO implementation, alert thresholds, recovery flows, operator tooling |
| Design system | Shared design principles, accessibility baseline, tokens/process if reused across apps | Brand expression, journeys, copy hierarchy, component compositions |
| Data/analytics | Shared event schema conventions and instrumentation patterns | Product KPIs, experiment design, funnel definitions, growth loops |
| Monetization support | Shared Stripe/analytics primitives, audit conventions | Pricing UX, onboarding UX, payout ops, entitlement rules, operator review workflows |

---

## Current-State Review

### Factory Strengths
- Package discipline and dependency ordering are already documented and enforced.
- Provisioning and scaffolding automation are significantly ahead of most teams at this stage.
- Operational runbooks exist for secrets, deployment, environment verification, and migrations.

### Factory Gaps
- The roadmap is heavily infrastructure-centric and less explicit about product quality, design review, and operational cadence.
- There is no single implementation board connecting package evolution, app rollout, and UX standards.
- Shared front-end quality expectations are implied, not operationalized.

### Core App Strengths
- NicheStream/videoking already has meaningful depth in realtime, payments, ads, subscriptions, and operator flows.
- The codebase shows good platform instincts: structured logging, retries, idempotency, role-based middleware, and clear route separation.

### Core App Gaps
- The improvement tracker is now behind the latest Phase 4 work and should no longer be treated as the source of truth.
- Monetization is technically deeper than before, but still lacks a complete operator-grade workflow around onboarding, payout operations, and regression tests.
- UI/UX quality is not yet managed as a formal workstream with accessibility, consistency, and journey-level success metrics.

---

## What “World Class” Means Here

### Coding
- Stable architecture boundaries.
- Type-safe contracts end to end.
- Regression tests around every money-moving and identity-sensitive workflow.
- Performance budgets enforced in CI.
- ADRs for non-trivial design choices.

### Process
- Definition of Ready and Definition of Done are explicit.
- Each workstream has exit criteria, KPIs, and dependencies.
- Weekly operating rhythm includes product, design, engineering, and operations review.
- Release management includes canary/staging verification, rollback, and post-release review.

### UI/UX
- Clear design principles and a reusable component language.
- Accessibility is audited, not assumed.
- Critical journeys are instrumented and optimized.
- Surfaces feel intentional and premium, not merely functional.

---

## World-Class UI/UX Operating Plan

The missing step is not more isolated polish work. It is an operating model that ties design, frontend engineering, accessibility, performance, analytics, and release evidence into one system.

### Objective

Ship customer-facing and operator-facing surfaces that are:
- immediately understandable,
- premium in visual hierarchy and motion,
- WCAG 2.2 AA compliant on critical paths,
- performant on real mobile networks,
- instrumented for conversion and trust,
- and reusable across Factory apps without flattening brand identity.

### Non-Negotiable Outcomes

| Outcome | Required proof |
|---|---|
| Shared primitives exist and are used | `@adrper79-dot/design-tokens` and `@adrper79-dot/ui` own tokens + core primitives; apps consume instead of hardcoding repeated styles |
| Critical journeys are explicitly designed | Every app has journey maps with acceptance criteria for anonymous, authenticated, paid, and operator flows |
| Accessibility is enforced in CI and manually verified | axe, keyboard-path review, screen-reader spot checks, and breakpoint checks are attached to PR evidence |
| Performance is treated as a release gate | Lighthouse/Core Web Vitals budgets are defined per surface and regressions block merge or release |
| UX success is measurable | PostHog + `factory_events` capture funnel, trust, and failure events for each critical journey |
| Release evidence includes UX proof | Screenshots, a11y proof, mobile proof, and happy/sad path evidence are part of Definition of Done |

### System Architecture For UI/UX Quality

| Layer | Factory responsibility | App responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Tokens | semantic colors, spacing, typography, motion, focus, density, breakpoints | brand palette choices within token constraints |
| Primitives | Button, Input, Label, Alert, Dialog, Toast, Tabs, Card, EmptyState, LoadingState | app-specific wrappers and composed product modules |
| Journey patterns | auth gate, checkout shell, dashboard shell, destructive-action confirmation, form validation pattern | information architecture, copy, domain-specific task flows |
| Quality gates | axe, Lighthouse, visual regression, interaction timing, mobile matrix, event schema validation | route-specific tests, product-specific fixtures, operator walkthroughs |
| Analytics | shared event naming conventions and funnel templates | app KPIs, experiment definitions, retention and conversion goals |

### Execution Workstreams

| Workstream | Scope | Owner disciplines | Exit criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| UX-01 Foundations | Tokens, primitives, component API, accessibility defaults, motion rules | D03, D04, D09, D12 | `design-tokens` and `ui` packages exist with docs, tests, and at least Button/Input/Dialog/Toast/FormField/Card shipped |
| UX-02 Journey design | Journey maps and acceptance criteria for public, auth, checkout, dashboard, and operator flows | D02, D03, D04, D14 | Each critical flow has a journey spec, success metric, failure states, and test plan |
| UX-03 Quality gates | axe, Lighthouse, visual diff, breakpoint matrix, keyboard path automation | D04, D09, D10, D12 | CI blocks regressions on agreed routes and publishes evidence artifacts |
| UX-04 Instrumentation | funnel, trust, rage-click/drop-off, error, and success event coverage | D02, D10, D12, D14 | Every critical journey emits required events and missing events fail tests |
| UX-05 Product polish | copy hierarchy, loading/success/error states, empty states, mobile density, operator ergonomics | D03, D04, D05, D14 | Core routes meet rubric and usability review on desktop + mobile |
| UX-06 Governance | design review, RFC usage, Definition of Ready/Done enforcement, launch review | D01, D03, D06, D12, D13 | No UI work starts without journey criteria and no UI work closes without UX evidence |

### Marketplace Quality Scorecard

Every launch candidate should be scored against these dimensions before it is called world-class.

| Dimension | Minimum bar | World-class bar |
|---|---|---|
| Clarity | user identifies primary action in <= 2 seconds | user identifies primary action, fallback path, and trust signal immediately |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.2 AA on critical routes | AA plus manual keyboard and screen-reader walkthrough evidence on all critical journeys |
| Performance | Lighthouse >= 85 and LCP <= 2.5s | Lighthouse >= 95, CLS <= 0.05, route transition feedback <= 100ms |
| Visual consistency | token usage and primitive reuse on core routes | coherent premium brand system with no ad-hoc exceptions on shipped routes |
| Trust | clear loading, success, error, and destructive-action states | trust states plus operator-safe recovery and audited money/auth flows |
| Conversion | funnels instrumented | funnels instrumented, benchmarked, and iterated with visible improvement targets |

### Release Gates For Any UI Surface

No customer-facing or operator-facing UI is release-ready until all of the following are true:
- Journey spec exists with happy path, sad path, edge cases, and KPI target.
- Design review references the rubric and breakpoint behavior.
- Tokens and primitives are used where applicable; ad-hoc styles are justified.
- axe passes with zero critical issues.
- Keyboard-only navigation is tested on all interactive routes.
- Lighthouse/mobile performance budget passes on target routes.
- Critical funnel and trust events are present and validated.
- Playwright or equivalent covers core happy path and at least one meaningful failure path.
- Direct HTTP verification and live smoke prove the deployed surface works.

### Delivery Sequence

| Phase | Goal | Concrete outputs |
|---|---|---|
| UX Phase 0 | Baseline and scoring | route inventory, journey inventory, current Lighthouse/a11y/mobile baselines, top 10 UX risks |
| UX Phase 1 | Shared foundation | `design-tokens`, `ui` primitives, usage guide, migration plan for SelfPrime/Admin Studio |
| UX Phase 2 | Route hardening | SelfPrime public/auth/dashboard polish, Admin Studio control-plane ergonomics, Xico shell patterns |
| UX Phase 3 | Measurement and regression gates | Lighthouse CI, visual regression, event verification, mobile matrix, screen-reader spot-check checklist |
| UX Phase 4 | Marketplace polish | trust cues, premium motion, empty states, onboarding refinement, conversion optimization backlog |

### Immediate Priority Order

1. Establish token and primitive packages so future UI work stops hardcoding styles per app.
2. Baseline SelfPrime, Admin Studio, and Xico critical journeys with measurable UX/performance/accessibility scores.
3. Add CI-grade Lighthouse and visual regression gates on the routes that already have Playwright and axe coverage.
4. Convert current route-level fixes into reusable patterns: auth gate, modal/dialog, feedback/toast, dashboard empty/loading/error states.
5. Make launch review require UX evidence alongside typecheck, test, deploy, and smoke evidence.

## Canonical Operating Model and Open Work Register

This section is the single place to answer: what exists, what is done, what is undone, what is not yet realized, and which agent owns updates.

### Source-of-Truth Rules

| Area | Canonical source | Update rule |
|---|---|---|
| Portfolio roadmap and open work | This dashboard | Only the coordinator agent updates roadmap status, open task state, and owner assignments |
| World Class 360 active task queue | `docs/operations/WORLD_CLASS_360_TASK_DASHBOARD.md` | This is the current iteration board for W360 items, immediate execution order, escaped work, and full Xico/Practitioner/Admin Studio slicing |
| Worker names, URLs, consumers, and rename safety | `docs/service-registry.yml` | Any worker rename or new hardcoded URL must update the registry in the same change |
| Admin Studio product plan | `docs/admin-studio/00-MASTER-PLAN.md` | Admin Studio features graduate here only after scope and exit criteria are known |
| Package dependency and standing constraints | `CLAUDE.md` | Treat as policy; do not duplicate or override elsewhere |
| Deployment and smoke verification procedures | `docs/runbooks/deployment.md` | Every deploy must end with direct HTTP verification, not only green CI |
| Session artifacts and one-off summaries | Root `*_SUMMARY.md` / `*_COMPLETE.md` files | Historical only; do not use as the live task board |

### Multi-Agent Coordination Process

1. One coordinator agent owns this dashboard and `MASTER_INDEX.md` / `PROJECT_STATUS.md` status references.
2. Specialist agents own bounded paths, for example one app, one package, or one workflow.
3. Specialist agents must not create new root-level summary files as task boards; they should report status back to the coordinator.
4. Before editing, every agent checks `git status`, recent commits, and this dashboard's ownership table.
5. Agents must not edit another agent's claimed paths unless the coordinator reassigns ownership.
6. Completion requires code merge, quality gates, docs update, service registry update if applicable, and direct endpoint verification for deployed services.
7. The working tree must not include generated dependency folders such as `node_modules/` or `dist/` in commits.

### Confirmed Done / Undone / Unrealized

### April 29 Reassessment — Changes Since Prior Deep Dive

| Domain | What improved | Still unresolved | Recommendation | Evidence / verification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Live video platform | Schedule migration, R2/Stream path, first successful renders, SelfPrime Stream embed, and synthetic monitor are now proven | Failure replay and operator-facing render exception handling still need a durable workflow | Treat video as `verified` for happy path and keep failure recovery as open work | `render-video.yml` runs `25120264469` and `25122396643`; direct health checks returned `200` for `schedule-worker`, `video-cron`, and `synthetic-monitor` on Apr 29 |
| Prompting / agent success | Active prompts now exist for agent success contract, OWR coordination, Phase E video/revenue work, and Admin Studio command-plane work | Old Stage 1 prompts remain historical and should not drive current implementation | Require future agents to start from `prompts/README.md` and quote the relevant prompt contract in their plan | `prompts/README.md`, `prompts/AGENT_SUCCESS_CONTRACT.md`, `prompts/OWR_COORDINATOR_PROMPT.md`, `prompts/PHASE_E_VIDEO_REVENUE_PROMPT.md`, `prompts/ADMIN_STUDIO_COMMAND_PLANE_PROMPT.md` |
| Package dependency safety | `@adrper79-dot/llm` runtime dependency misclassification and changelog gap were corrected; cross-package smoke CI was added and passed | Keep the workflow active for package-sensitive PRs and publishing prep | Use the workflow as the runtime dependency drift gate before package publish-sensitive changes | `packages/llm/package.json`, `packages/llm/CHANGELOG.md`, `.github/workflows/package-integration.yml`, `scripts/package-integration-smoke.mjs`; llm lint/typecheck/test/build passed during `npm install` prepublish on Apr 29; local package chain build + smoke passed; Actions run 25124117458 passed |
| Smoke and accessibility | Prime Self smoke/a11y gates, synthetic monitor, and real-credential auth e2e (OWR-023) represent a stronger live-quality loop | Coverage is still uneven across apps; app-level analytics event verification is not a release gate | Make smoke/a11y/event proof mandatory for app launch gates | `apps/prime-self-smoke`, `.github/workflows/smoke-prime-self.yml`, `apps/synthetic-monitor`, `adrper79-dot/prime-self-ui` run 25123827532 |
| Admin Studio | Control-plane requirements are now clearer and prompt-backed | Production command-plane safety remains incomplete: real auth, RBAC, dry-run, audit, smoke auth, UI tabs, and PR/deploy governance | Sequence Admin Studio work through the command-plane prompt; do not allow production mutation until safety model passes tests | `prompts/ADMIN_STUDIO_COMMAND_PLANE_PROMPT.md`, `apps/admin-studio`, `apps/admin-studio-ui`, `packages/studio-core` |
| Workflow operations | `render-video.yml` already has job-ID concurrency and successful run evidence | Workflow inventory, deployment dependencies, metric freshness, and recovery playbooks are not centralized | Create workflow coordination doc and pre-deploy health gate pattern | `.github/workflows/render-video.yml`, `.github/workflows/`, `scripts/phase-6-orchestrator.mjs` |

### Reassessment Priority Stack

| Priority | Action | Owner mode | Exit criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | Commit the `@adrper79-dot/llm` runtime dependency and changelog fix | Package specialist | `llm` quality gates pass; changelog has `0.2.0`; package-lock shows runtime deps |
| P0 | Enforce the new active prompt contract for all future agents | Coordinator | Every new task plan cites an active prompt and dashboard/OWR item before edits |
| P1 | Build cross-package integration CI | Platform specialist | Workflow and smoke script exist; CI catches runtime dependency drift and validates package chain composition |
| P1 | Create workflow coordination/deploy-gate documentation | DevOps specialist | Workflow trigger/order/recovery matrix exists and deploy workflows reference health gates |
| P1 | Convert Admin Studio command-plane requirements into tests and protected routes | Admin Studio specialist | Real auth, dry-run, audit, smoke auth, RBAC, and rollback evidence exist |
| P2 | Replace stale historical docs or mark them non-canonical | Coordinator + docs | `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, runbooks, and VideoKing baseline clearly reference the dashboard as current truth |

#### Done

- Phase B dashboard initiatives are documented as 28/28 complete.
- Core package publish chain was repaired; `@adrper79-dot/schedule@0.2.1` and `@adrper79-dot/video@0.2.0` are published.
- `schedule-worker` and `video-cron` deploy workflows have successful runs.
- Direct HTTP health checks for `schedule-worker` and `video-cron` returned `200` on Apr 29.
- Worker service registry entries exist for `prime-self`, `schedule-worker`, `video-cron`, and the `videoking` reference entry.
- Admin Studio master plan exists with environment safety, code, test, deploy, database, content, operations, and AI-assisted workflows.

#### Undone

- Consolidated ownership cleanup is not finished; there are uncommitted local changes and generated artifacts.
- Render failure recovery, replay, and operator escalation are not yet proven as a full drill.
- Phase 7 app scaffolding validation remains open after infrastructure confirmation.
- Admin Studio GUI AI commands are not yet a production control surface.
- App function manifests are now adopted across active Worker services; continue extending smoke probes as additional app routes become production-ready.
- Workflow coordination and metric freshness are not yet centrally documented.

#### Unrealized / Not Yet Designed Deeply Enough

- A durable command schema for Admin Studio AI actions: every GUI AI command needs intent, target repo/path, environment, risk tier, dry-run output, approval policy, audit event, rollback plan, and PR/deploy linkage.
- A portfolio dependency graph that answers which apps consume which packages, Workers, secrets, queues, databases, R2 buckets, Pages projects, and workflows.
- A formal task object model that Studio can read/write: work item, owner, scope paths, status, blockers, verification evidence, linked commits, linked workflow runs, and linked endpoints.
- A cross-repo release train UI that coordinates package publish order, app lockfile updates, staging deploys, production deploys, smoke tests, and rollbacks.
- A governance rule that all future agents update machine-readable status through Studio or a single dashboard-backed API instead of creating ad hoc markdown summaries.

### Admin Studio Command-Plane Requirements

The Admin Studio should eventually manage this process through GUI AI commands, but only after it implements these standard functions:

| Function | Minimum capability | Safety requirement |
|---|---|---|
| Work register | Create, update, assign, block, unblock, and close tasks | Coordinator approval for status changes touching roadmap or production |
| Repo inventory | List repos, packages, Workers, Pages apps, databases, secrets, workflows, and consumers | Read-only by default; writes go through PRs |
| AI command intake | Convert natural-language commands into structured action plans | Always show target environment, files, risks, and dry-run diff before execution |
| Path ownership | Claim/release file globs for specialist agents | Block conflicting writes unless coordinator overrides |
| Code changes | Branch, edit, test, commit, and open PR | Never commit directly to `main`; use optimistic concurrency and PR review |
| Test runner | Run selected suites and stream results | Persist run IDs, logs, coverage, and failure analysis |
| Deploy control | Trigger staging/production deploys and watch logs | Production deploy requires CI green, smoke pass, type-to-confirm, and rollback link |
| Endpoint verification | Run direct `curl`/HTTP probes against service registry endpoints | CI green is insufficient; record observed HTTP status and timestamp |
| Audit log | Record every mutating Studio action | Redact secrets; include user, env, target, command, result, and request ID |
| Rollback | Generate and execute rollback steps | Must show reversibility tier and required approvals before action |

---

## Definition of Ready

A work item is ready only when:
- the user or operator outcome is explicit,
- the owning scope is assigned to Factory support or the app,
- dependencies are named,
- success metrics are defined,
- and design, data, and operational implications are understood.

## Definition of Done

A work item is done only when:
- implementation is merged,
- validation is executed,
- docs and runbooks are updated,
- observability is in place,
- and the relevant dashboard metric or exit criterion is updated.

---

## Recommended First Implementation Slice

If execution starts later, begin here in order:
1. Re-baseline videoking documentation and open risks.
2. Publish the shared design, accessibility, and release rubrics.
3. Add focused regression tests for subscriptions, payouts, and DLQ recovery.
4. Design the creator onboarding and payout operations journeys end to end.
5. Stand up the first implementation scorecard tied to this dashboard.

---

## Planning Note

This document is intentionally implementation-oriented. It does **not** authorize execution by itself. It exists so implementation can begin later with one cohesive, measurable plan across Factory support and the core app.
