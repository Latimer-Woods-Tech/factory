# factory

Shared CI/CD, infrastructure, and packages for every app in the **Latimer-Woods-Tech** organization.

If you're an agent or a new contributor, **start here**, then go to:
- [`docs/AGENTS.md`](docs/AGENTS.md) — explicit agent onboarding guide
- [`docs/CI_CD.md`](docs/CI_CD.md) — CI/CD architecture
- [`docs/NEW_APP_CHECKLIST.md`](docs/NEW_APP_CHECKLIST.md) — adding a new app to the ecosystem

## What this repo is

factory is the **plumbing layer**. Every app in the org imports from it. It owns:

| Layer | Where | What |
|---|---|---|
| Reusable CI/CD workflows | `.github/workflows/_*.yml` | `_app-ci.yml`, `_app-deploy.yml`, `_post-deploy-verify.yml` |
| Shared npm packages | `packages/*` | 12 packages published to GitHub Packages under `@latimer-woods-tech/*` |
| Provisioning workflows | `.github/workflows/*` | One-shot scripts for R2, Hyperdrive, secrets, scaffolding |
| Documentation | `docs/*` | Architecture, runbooks, checklists, ADRs |

This repo is **public** so private apps can `uses:` its reusable workflows. It contains zero secrets in code (all secrets live in the GitHub Secrets vault).

## Quick reference for app maintainers

Add CI to a new or existing app — replace the entire `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with:

```yaml
name: ci
on:
  push: { branches: [main] }
  pull_request:
jobs:
  ci:
    uses: Latimer-Woods-Tech/factory/.github/workflows/_app-ci.yml@main
    secrets: inherit
```

Add deploy — replace `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with:

```yaml
name: deploy
on:
  push: { branches: [main] }
jobs:
  deploy:
    uses: Latimer-Woods-Tech/factory/.github/workflows/_app-deploy.yml@main
    with:
      environment: production
      health_url: https://your-app.example.com/healthz
    secrets: inherit
```

That's it. Inherit conventions, get free CI/CD, stop drifting.

For deeper reference: [`docs/CI_CD.md`](docs/CI_CD.md).

## Status snapshot

The hourly `factory-status-dashboard.yml` workflow generates `docs/STATUS.md` with the live build state of every repo. If that file is stale, the workflow has been failing — check `.github/workflows/factory-status-dashboard.yml` runs.

Quick one-liners:
- Org-level Actions secrets: `gh api /orgs/Latimer-Woods-Tech/actions/secrets`
- Reusable workflow live test: see [`docs/CI_CD.md#verifying-cross-repo-access`](docs/CI_CD.md#verifying-cross-repo-access)
- Open PRs across the ecosystem: see `docs/STATUS.md`
